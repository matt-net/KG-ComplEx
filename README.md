This project implements a training and evaluation pipeline for entity-relation embedding models. 
The model is designed to train on a dataset of triples and corresponding labels and can be customized with different hyperparameters.


### Requirements

Please make sure the following dependencies are installed. 

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

To start training the model, run the following command:
```bash
python train.py
```

Once training is complete, you can evaluate the model using:
```bash
python eval.py
```
